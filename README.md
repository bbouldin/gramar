## Background

Gramar is a next-generation greenfield implementation of both Eclipse Model-to-Text JET and, before that, the Design pattern Toolkit from IBM.  A gramar can be applied not just in Eclipse, but in IntelliJ, as a stand-alone java application, within a web application or in any other environment.
